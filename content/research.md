1. **Partial Coverage in Regulation: Can Carbon TradingPilot Benefit Embedded Carbon in Supply Chains?**  
   *Co-authered with*: Shaobo Hou and Wenzheng Niu
   *Status*: Submitted to the *Management Science, Reject and Resubmit*
   *Presentation*: Renmin Univerisity China*, University of Nottingham Ningbo China
   *Abstract*: Adopting a dual-perspective approach of supply chain buyers and sellers, we examine how the “partial regulation"”characteristic of market-oriented carbon regulations in emerging economies shapes carbon emissions within domestic supply chains. Drawing on externality theory and power-dependence theory, we develop an analytical framework centered on the distribution of decision-making power. Our findings indicate that when buyers (sellers) are subject to carbon regulation constraints, supply chain carbon emissions decrease (increase) significantly. Supply chain bargaining power plays a pivotal moderating role in the aforementioned relationships: the stronger the bargaining power of buyers (sellers), the more pronounced the emission reduction (increase) effect of partial regulation on supply chain carbon emissions. Further analysis reveals that common institutional ownership can exert a synergistic governance effect, suppressing supply chain carbon emissions under both buyer-oriented and seller-oriented partial regulation scenarios. Overall, our study offers a novel perspective for unraveling regulatory asymmetry at the supply chain level.

3. **Shared Tongues but Exploited Trust: The Effect of Dialect Similarity on Trade Credit Exploitation**  
   *Co-authered with*: Meihe E and Wenzheng Niu  
   *Status*: Submitted to the *Journal of Business Ethics, Under Review*
   *Presentation*: Renmin Univerisity China*, University of Nottingham Ningbo China
   *Abstract*: Similar languages can foster trust, which may also be opportunistically exploited. In the context of China’s multiple dialects and credit rationing, we identify the phenomenon of opportunistic exploitation of trade credit through exploiting trust between firms. Utilizing the supply chain relationship data from 2003 to 2023, we argue for and provide empirical evidence that a higher level of dialect similarity between the top executives of the listed firms with financing advantages and those of their suppliers is associated with increased long-term trade credit within the supply chain, which suggests that dialect similarity plays a significantly positive role in the opportunistic exploitation of trade credit. Our findings are consistent and robust to an instrumental variable regression strategy and a series of robustness checks. Mechanism testing highlight both the opportunistic focal firm exploiters and overly trusting targeted suppliers, revealing that these effects are more pronounced among top executives of disadvantaged suppliers with higher trust propensity and those of the advantaged focal firm with higher opportunistic propensity, respectively.
