I am a recent Master’s graduate in Economics, Money and Finance (Finance and Investment) from the School of Economics, University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), actively pursuing PhD opportunities in Finance and Economics.

Prior to my master’s study, I received my Bachelor of Economics degree from Henan University. At UNNC, I graduated with Distinction and was awarded both the School Prize for Excellent Academic Performance and the Best Dissertation Award (achieving the highest score in the MSc programme).

My research focuses on corporate finance, entrepreneurial finance, the economics & regulation of innovation, and the Chinese financial system. Influenced by my postgraduate training, I also maintain strong research interests in household finance and public economics.
